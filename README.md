## Types of input filtration

In the context of software development and security, input sensitization refers to the process of validating and filtering user inputs to ensure they meet certain criteria and prevent potential security vulnerabilities. There are two main types of input sensitization: inbound input sensitization and outbound input sensitization.

### [Inbound input filtration](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/Inbound-input-filtration)

Inbound input filtration focuses on validating and filtering user inputs as they enter the system. It involves allowing only inputs that conform to a specific pattern or format, while blocking or sanitizing any potentially malicious or malformed inputs.

To achieve inbound input filtration, developers can implement various techniques such as input validation, sanitization, and filtration. These techniques involve using specific algorithms or libraries to examine and verify the user's input against predefined rules, patterns, or constraints. By allowing only inputs that match the specified pattern, developers can ensure the integrity and security of the system.

Inbound input filtration helps prevent security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), or SQL injection. It ensures that the data entering the system is valid and meets the required format or criteria.

### Outbound input filtration

Outbound input filtration, as part of input filtration, focuses on restricting the output or response generated by the system. It involves disallowing specific patterns or formats in the output, ensuring that it adheres to the desired criteria and doesn't leak sensitive information or expose vulnerabilities.

Developers implement outbound input filtration at the input time, not the output time. It ensures that any data generated by the system is filtered or modified to eliminate or sanitize any disallowed patterns or content.

By implementing outbound input filtration and disallowing particular patterns, developers can enhance the security and reliability of their software systems. It helps prevent data leakage, protects against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and ensures that the generated output meets the expected format and criteria.

Both inbound and outbound input filtration are important steps in ensuring the security and reliability of software systems. By validating and filtering inputs as they enter the system and disallowing specific patterns in the output, developers can mitigate security risks and provide a safer experience for users.

Remember to always follow best practices and leverage appropriate security libraries or frameworks to implement input filtration effectively.
